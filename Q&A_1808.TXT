Find the names of all employees who are working in the project Computerisation.
 SELECT E.Fname, E.Minit, E.Lname

 FROM EMPLOYEE E

 JOIN WORKS_ON W ON E.Ssn = W.Essn

 JOIN PROJECT P ON W.Pno = P.Pnumber

 WHERE P.Pname = 'Computerization';

For each department whose average employee salary is more than $30,000, retrieve the department name and the number of employees working for that department.
 SELECT D.DNAME, COUNT(*)

 FROM DEPARTMENT D

 JOIN EMPLOYEE E ON D.DNUMBER = E.DNO

 GROUP BY D.DNAME

 HAVING AVG(E.SALARY) > 30000;

Suppose that we want the number of male employees in each department making more than $30,000, rather than the number of all employees. Can we specify this query in SQL? Why or why not?
 SELECT D.DNAME, COUNT(*)

 FROM DEPARTMENT D, EMPLOYEE E

 WHERE D.DNUMBER = E.DNO AND E.SEX='M' AND E.DNO IN (

     SELECT DNO

     FROM EMPLOYEE

     GROUP BY DNO

     HAVING AVG(SALARY) > 30000

 )

 GROUP BY D.DNAME;
